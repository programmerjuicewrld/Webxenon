            <h1>Research and Innovation</h1>
            <p>Ethiopian Agricultural sector has poor tradition of being innovative and adaptive to new challenges. It has proven to be highly inefficient and uncompetitive both in local and international markets. The outlook for the Ethiopian agricultural sector potential is strong, with the local and international demand for food rising, driven by population growth and calls for higher quality and greater variety of food.</p>
            <p>Investment in research and development (R&D) and innovation is vital for ongoing growth and improvement in the productivity, profitability, competitiveness and sustainability of Ethiopian agriculture, fisheries, forestry and food industries.</p>
            <p>As AgTraIn, we believe Innovation is a process of not only creating knowledge, but making it available and putting it into use by</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Combining different sources of knowledge</li>
                <li>Can be a new idea or a novel combination of existing approaches/knowledge</li>
                <li>Process relies on interaction between different sources of knowledge</li>
                <li>Networks of diverse and import stakeholders</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To accomplish this and see transformed Ethiopian Agriculture, As AgTraIn, we would like to participate and collaborate in solving the agricultural challenges to deliver cutting-edge technology and applied research, with an emphasis on making the results accessible to Ethiopian smallholder farmers.
            </p>
            <p>Our objectives are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Securing viable food production 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Recognizes that the large number of small holder farmers could not gain an economic return from individual investment in R&D and that farm products are largely uniform and non-rival in nature</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Ensuring sustainable management of natural resources and climate action
                    <ul>
                        <li>Addresses important national development and sustainability objectives, such as food security and natural resource management</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Contributing to a balanced development according to the resources we have.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Acknowledges the significant efforts of actors and rural benefits that increase from publicly supported R&D</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The objectives involve creating, sharing and implementing new knowledge, new technologies, new products and new ways to organize, learn and cooperate</p><br>
            <p>To achieve the objectives, we would like to engage ourselves through partnership agreement framework, mobilize skilled individual Ethiopian professionals across the globe working in different agricultural and natural resource management sectors, Private company owners, Federal and regional governments, NGO’s, and universities and research centers to develop and implement a national approach for rural research, development and extension (RD&E) in Ethiopia. We would like to establish Research and Innovation Committee for the Agriculture Sector for improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of existing agricultural extension system, to maximize the contribution of RD&E to smallholder farmers, rural and regional Ethiopia and the wider community. The Committee is made up of representatives from the Federal government, Regional governments’ responsible Research centers, NGOs and universities.</p>
